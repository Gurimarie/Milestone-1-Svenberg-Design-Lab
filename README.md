## User Experience (UX)

### User stories:

### First time visitor goals
To find information about a company I'm curious about. To see their projects and their style. To confirm the quality and trustworthyness of the company.

### Returning visitor goals
To be able to find the project I'm looking for quicly. Perhaps look at different projects and different design-areas than on my first visit. Get a feel for the company as a whole.

### Frequent user goals
To be able to find the project I'm looking for quicly, and to be able to see all projects in each design-area on one page, in order to compare and find what is interesting.

### Site owner goals
To show prospective customers and partners what we do, our style and our high quality. As we work in several different design-areas, it is important that the visitor understands that they are at the right company-site regardless of what area they first have come in contact with. Therefore the different ares must be shown as equals, and not (for instance) primarily interior-design, and the other areas as additions. 
Another important reason behind the site is simply to collect and showcase previous project in one coherent space. 

## Design

### Colour scheme:

### Typography:
Font Poppins for headlines and Open Sans for other text.  
<br>
Poppins is a straight-forward, easily-approachable font, that is both elegant and simple, and that has rounded shapes that makes it feel trustworthy. We want a font that is elegant, but not old-fashioned, and not too avant-guard. Poppins is just the right mix.  
<br>
Open Sans works well with Poppins, as it has much of the same overall feeling, a simple, nicely spaced look (not too narrow), and with lovely old-fashioned g's that gives it a nice, comforting feeling.
